<a href="https://trvinh.github.io/phyloprofile/" target="_blank">PhyloProfile</a> is my very first <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank">R</a> application. During my PhD project, I had to find a way to represent a big phylogenetic profile of more than 1500 <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia" target="_blank">Microspodiria</a> proteins. Plotting a traditional phylogenetic profile, a 0/1 matrix basically, is not an issue any more. However, my problem was, that I need to show more information beside those 0 and 1 in order to make the plot more informative.

My best colleague, <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke" target="_blank">Bastian</a> - the guy who knows everything, gave me a great idea about using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com" target="_blank">Shiny</a> to play with interactive plots. The more I use Shiny, the more R surprises me about its ability. It's been giving me an enthusiasm for exploring this interesting language :)

So, now I'm learning to say rrrrrrrRRRRRRRrrrrrrr......!!!
